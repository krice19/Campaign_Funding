# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to evaluate different campaigns to analyze the relationship between their outcome and two important factors.  The first factor is analyzing how they fared in relation to their launch date. We will be looking at which campaigns were successful,  whichs ones failed, or which ones were cancled, based on what month they were launched in. The second factor is fundraising goals, and we will analyze the outcome of the campaign based on their goal amount.
