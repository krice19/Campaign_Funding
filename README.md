# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate different campaign kickstarters to analyze the relationship between their outcome of success and two important factors, launch date and goal amount.  I  specifically looked into the theather category,  in hopes to help Louise understand outcomes based on launch date and fundraising. goal amount.  The first factor I analyzed is how campaigns fared in relation to their launch date. Within this factor, I looked at which campaigns were successful,  which ones failed, or which ones were cancled, based on what month they were launched in. The second factor I analyzed is the outcome based on fundraising goal amount.  Here, I looked at the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled outcomes based a specific goal range. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To begin, I looked at a data sheet of multilple kickstarters and details on their goal amount, pledged amount, the outcome of the campaign, dates for deadline and launch, and category and subcategory.  The dates were orginally provided in Unix timestamp format, but I was able to convert the value using the following code:<br />
(((A1/60)/60)/24) + DATE(1970,1,1)<br />
A1 refers to the cell with unix timestamp value. <br />
I also used the text to columns feature in excel to seperate the values in the "category and subcategory" column into two different colomuns.   This way, can analyze the data by category and subcategory individually.  <br />
I used the YEAR() function to extract the year from the converted unix time stamp, so we can evaluate outcomes based on specific years.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this analysis, I created a pivot table from the kickstarter data to focus on the count of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns.  I filtered the pivot table by year and category.  I applied "theater" within the category filter since we are looking at theater campaigns.  From the pivot table, I created a chart that evaluates the count of outcomes based on months.  The years in the analysis range from 2009 to 2017, but my chart focuses on outcomes by month.  This means that within each month, it is pulling in all data from the year range.

The most amount of successful campaigns for theater from 2009 to 2017 were launched in May.  The number of canceled theater campaings stayed relatively low throughout every month.  In October, we can see the variance between the number of successful and failed campaigns is smaller, suggesting that the end of the year may not be a good time to launch a campaign.  We can also filter the table by year to see the trends within a sepcific year.  We see the first failed campaign data point starting in 2014, showing that there were only successes within our data range from 2009 to 2013.

In December 2014, we see the number of failed campaigns is higher than the number of succesfful campaigns. There seems to be trend that the number of campaigns are not as successful towards the end of the year, so it is useful to develop insights to why. This could be a result of the Holidays, as people typically spend more money around this time, which would make them less inclined to help a kickstarter.

However, this possibility would depend on various factors, such as the country of the kickstarter, because holidays and culutural celebrations vary by region.  However, this is not a factor we analyzed in the table.  The year a kickstarter is launched in can also give us different conclusions because the economy is different every year.
### Analysis on Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis, I looked at the outcome of the subcategory "plays" within the theater cateogry based on goal amount. The data I extracted was the total number of successes, failures, and canceled campaings within a certain monetary value range.  I was able to use COUNTIFS function to extract this data based on the specifications.  An example of the code is below: <br />
=COUNTIFS('Kickstarter Data'!$D:$D,"<49999",  'Kickstarter Data'!$D:$D,">=45000",'Kickstarter Data'!$F:$F, "Failed",'Kickstarter Data'!$R:$R, "plays") <br />
I changed the number values to fit certain ranges.  I started at a range of "less than 1000" and worked up to a range of "greater than 50,000", each range in increments of 4999.  I took the count for each outcome, the sum for each monetary range, and calculated the percentages of the outcomes.  
![OutcomesGoal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63257696/115797046-fb3b6280-a3a0-11eb-86da-46464ab2d429.png)
We can see that lower goal amounts have a greater percentage of successes.  The highest percentage of successful play kickstarters were launched with a goal range on less than $1000, at 76%.  We start to see a rise in failed play campaigns at the $15000-$19999 range.  However, we see a spike in successful campaings again around $35000 - $40000.  Towards the higher goal ranges, the percentage outcome varies more dramatically. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One challenge I faced when gathering this data was that I forgot to add one of the goal ranges in my initial attempt of the outcomes based on goals analysis.  Overlooking a simple step like this could definiately change the results of the data.  If I did not include the "less than $1000" range, which is the range with the highest success percentage, I would have gotten a different outcome on what the highest range was and the data would be telling a different story.
## Results 
Based of my analysis, I can make the follow two conclusions on Theater outcomes by launch date:
* The most successful kickstarters for the theater category from 2009 - 2017 were launched in May.
* The number of successes and failures are relatively the same in Decemeber, concluding you have a lower change of success when launching a kickstarter in this time of year.<br />
<br />
From my outcomes based off goal amount analysis, I can make the following conclusion:<br />
You will have a greater chance of success when launching your campaign at a lower and reasonable goal amount.<br />
<br />
However, I think we should question the results of the data to understand what made each success.  We should not rely on just two factors in an analysis to base what made a campaign successful.  A limitation for the theater outcomes by launch date analysis is that we only see failed campaigns starting in 2014, so the number of successes in the first 5 years of data might be pulling the successful numbers in a greater direction as opposed to failed, which can skew our data set.  Additionally, another limitation is that the process we used of looking at data throughout 2009 -2017 and summing the total numbers by month may not be the most telling. May had the most number of successful outcomes, but this may not always guarantee that May is the best most to launch a kickstarter in.  The results within a year can vary based on outside factors, like the economy or yearly events.  <br />
In the the outcomes based on goal amounts analysis, our graph is not the most telling when it comes to looking at the actual data set. In the actual data set, 96% of the count of outcomes are in a range less than $24999. When we graph this data in percentages, the graph does not tell us how many data points are being evaluated in each range.  For example, the $45000 to $49999 goal range only had one campaign evaluated, and that campaign failed, therefore showing the percentage of failed campaings to be 100%.  The higher goal ranges a low amount of campaigns evaluated, allowing each outcome to fluctuate the percentage by a greater amount. 
I would suggest created more charts similar to the two extra I included in my theater outcomes by launch date analysis - I added to thse charts to show the results within different year ranges because I think year is an important factor that could change the outcome.   When looking at the outcomes based on goal ranges, we can take another factor in our data, for example we could take campaign duration, and see how that compares within each goal range and outcome percentage.
